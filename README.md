# VR-LetterDrawing

I used C# and Unity to create a database containing a virtual reality controller's position while drawing an "O," "S," and "C." I then created a machine-learning model in Python based on that data. In Unity, I would draw "O," "S," or "C" with the VR controller and send that data through the machine learning program, which accurately determines the letter drawn. The youtube link below shows this working in real-time.
