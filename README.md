# VR-LetterDrawing

I used Python and Unity to create a database used as a training set of contain virtual reality controller positions while drawing an "O," "S," and "C." I then used a linear regression model in Python based on that data, but it would have been better off using a clustering model (deadlines). In Unity, I would draw "O," "S," or "C" with the VR controller and send that data through the machine learning program, which accurately determines the letter drawn.
